# big restructuring

capabilities / protottpes /functioanlites
- framework choice somewhere
move background section into literature revire from introduction
subsection 2.6 and 2.7, 2.8 subsubsections
design 3.2 what projects wanted to do the same into part 2

move multi-reply vs unique into literature review

3.4 requiremnets design decisions to be taken - need to move into 4

6.2 into literature overview

# list of functionalities
- interfacing with argdown etc
- games design
- data formay at output

# general

# introductio
exploratory proejct, both theoretical and practical difficulties
functionality and design not known in advance

make the ending more clear
more direct, argumentin minig - why importna topc why the core problem
1.2 add why importnatn
why data as the bottleneck

introduction is not discussed - the reference to the bag of words is a null pointer 
- what problem
- why importnat
- high lievel of address
- how to structureG
- move stuff elsewhere

argument as an exmpample

capaibilties
- argument tree
- import from a format
- mobile pp
- problems and successes

introduce proof-of-concept of specific functionalities, so less thatn a proptotpye
mention criitcal thinkign skills

# abstract

# chapter 1 literature survey
static vs non-static argument schemas

inter-annotator agreemetn from 2008
https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/34/4/555/1999/Inter-Coder-Agreement-for-Computational

give page number to the longer quote after flow pipeline

the 'crowdsourced model' at the end of 2.1 is unclear

2.2 fact check the Turkers paper whether experts

## literaturs

## similar software 

## argdown and aifdb
provide argdown examples of the example

# chapter 3 requirements analysis
cancel the semantic network bit

more on functional, with more structure - the games descriptions

explain unique vs multi-reply

## more important
- interfacing with aifdb, argdown

## less importantn - nice to haves
multiplayer planned to not have
deployment

starting from scratch or with an existing argument modes

## outline use scenarios
- leaderboard
- annotation in a debate - not gwap but ok

# chapter 4 design
top down view of organization and functional capabilities


## user journey
first on user journey

## game modes focus
elaborate on game modes
showing the tree

## debate design
snapshot of global support

## games desdisn
screenshots

design flowchart


# chapter 5 implementation

code traps exampls
5 is a collection of nodes through logical sequence of tools, which fuctionalities implemented and which not, also screenshots

## architecture
archictecture diagram
text after the diagram, diagram only to support the reader

specify problems in more detail

## tools choice
compare supabase and react native against alternatives

## frontend software choice
games sccreenshots

specify problems in more detail

how does the example look here as a screen?

## backend software choice
backend in the end

how does the example look here as a backend data structure?

specify problems in more detail

# chapter 6 results

# chapter 7 conclusion
