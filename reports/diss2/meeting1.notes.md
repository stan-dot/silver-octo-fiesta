# meeting notes
either capabilities, or what prototypes and what problems and functionalities

talk about Argdown, next level of detail of what I've done

chapter 3, 4 requirements and fucional requirements, and design

that it was an explorative project, so not a standard build toward specification
need list of objectives
to sell the idea
both theoretical and practicial difficulties

say that multiplayer nice to have, not a functional requiremnt, so just design

to make the point look as if planned - that's the nature or writing history here

section on backend implementation, framework, etc

capabilities better if no discrete prototypes

<!-- maybe titled aspects - interfacing, games, and data  -->

clear design needed - as in the document.
elements of the system screen

screenshots of the app
structure of the app - different.
architecture and interaction (2) diagrams

expand user journey
start with that, backend later

clearer discintion between new argument and using an existing text

not end the abstract on a negative, mention in the discussion

leave deployment, mulitplayer as non-mandatory

end of introduction - needs to be clear
<!-- say that  -->
spell out that more

move background section into literature review, not in introduction

in intro more direct, argument mining from text is becoming important topic, aplications include

not enou9gh data - the core problem - short description is alright, the most clear
1.2. add why it is importnat
- argument mining important
- why data is the bottlenck

<!-- repeat the need into capabilities -->
as milestones

identifying the framework.

subsection 2.6 and 2.7, 2.8 subsubsections

conclusion to the literature review chapter

need to make software choices
benefit of the mobile application

in chapter 2 
- supabase
- expo with react native
- AIFdb
- argdown

tangential references can be pruned if the rest too long

stakeholder analysis good

3.2 what projects wanted to do the same into part 2

functional requirements too brief,too little structure
CRUD wrt the argument, import

display of argument tree and new argument, crud - unknonw, too high level
3.4 cannot be in the future - whole section a bit weird

no time for pondering left, only refer to secions before, not exactly new quotations
like menu selection

chapter 4

starting with backend is harsh, need preamble, overview diagram
reordering the sections

no idea what games are at the point

game modes, multiplayer - moved to chapter 3 probably

user journey should be at the start, there introduce the games
interaction diagram. 
can assume the user already downloadaed the app, already using
what are the available topics?
number list or flowchart
text after the flow diagram, merely to support the reader

it appeared that the tree is appearing there

examples of arguments
in the desgin section?, a running one through many chatpers
to have an argument in the introduction.
in chapter 2 notations for the same arguments - in AIFdb for instance

by the end of chatper 4 can do sketches, designs, mockups

chatper 5 where the problems are

chapter 6 - multiplayer reference - aware that it's a stretch goal

exploratory project with rapid prototyping

6.2 could go to literature overview, could be referenced later

# extracted froim the text
- intro make objective that functionality and design - not known than in advance
- more details for 3 and 4 (requiremnets anddesign)
- impelmentation - series of prototpyes or capabilities

capaibilties
- argument tree
- import from a format
- mobile pp
- problems and successes

abstract too negative

introduction is not discussed - the reference to the bag of words is a null pointer 
- what problem
- why importnat
- high lievel of address
- how to structureG
- move stuff elsewhere

part 2 - intro should summaries
static vs non-static argument schemes

inter-annotator agreemetn from 2008
https://direct.mit.edu/coli/article/34/4/555/1999/Inter-Coder-Agreement-for-Computational

give page number to the longer quote after flow pipeline

the 'crowdsourced model' at the end of 2.1 is unclear

2.2 talk what Turkers were asked to do
was is paid experts? or not - need to fact check

section 3 intro right now has irrelevant info on semantic network

functional, non-functional paragraphs too high level
needs more structure

ad design decisions - explain the difference between unique vs multi-reply

backed data structures - user has no idea

needs to be illustrated with an example

should introduce SUpabase earlier, or at least explain

frontend interactions with th ebackedn is an implementation detial

muiltiplyer features - need to seperarte

snapshot of the global support

need to outline use scenarios
diagram for user journetG

reduce the interaction steps, clear description of the sessio, also the tree

chapter 4 - need top down view of organization and functioanl capabilities

chapter 5
need to talk about th epreoof of concepts

examples of code traps
5 is a collection of nodes through logical sequence of tools, which fuctionalities implemented and which not, also screenshots

positive decisiong to exclude multipleyer features
name and number of each prototy.e

mention the aim of critical thinkign skills earlier

in conclusion it is noted that libraries are not compared against alternatives
