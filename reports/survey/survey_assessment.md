## outline
For students taking COM3610 the report should be between 3000 and 6000 words.
Instead the review should be organised and structured in a meaningful way, and the themes and relationships between the references identified. 
You should expect to redraft the review several times in order to arrive at a text that is clearly written, easy to understand, but that displays an in-depth understanding of the topic. 

This should be two or three short paragraphs (100-150 words total), summarising the report.
A suggested flow is background, project aims, and achievements to date. It should not simply be a restatement of the original project outline.
- set the scene for the project by giving a little relevant background information - try to grab the reader's interest early.
- ginally, the introduction should summarise the remaining chapters of the report, in effect giving the reader an overview of what is to come.

Think of the review as writing an essay on the background literature for your project. 
A good literature survey should demonstrate your awareness and understanding of the background literature to your topic. 
- begin by setting the proposed research in a wide context



## Assessment

Quality of literature review / technology survey / review of similar software tools:
 The ability to understand/synthesize/combine/evaluate/analyse/categorise relevant work is being considered here.

Quality of overall work (as ascertained from the report):
 This category mainly focuses on the analysis that has been done to date, and which should be complete for most projects. However, since for some types of project the analysis may be ongoing, this category looks at the work as a whole.

Amount of work completed:
 [somewhat self-descriptive] The amount of work done in relation to what could be reasonably expected to be done on the particular project, given its level of difficulty and the time available.

Report presentation: The readability of the report and the precision of its language will be judged here, along with the overall presentation: sensible notation, diagrams, layout, headings, references, etc.

Some of the questions that supervisor and second examiners will consider in marking the report are:

Is the project clearly defined?

Are the objectives attainable?

Does the student know what they are doing?

Does the student have a clear understanding of what is still required in order to produce a satisfactory final dissertation?

Is progress so far satisfactory?

Does the literature survey synthesize information from several sources?

Are sources suitably referenced and is the bibliography/list of citations adequate?

Have potential problems and possible processes/tools/techniques been identified?

Is the writing clear, precise and of the standard to be expected for a degree in science or engineering?

Is the plan of action realistic?

The following list gives an indication of what is being looked for in the overall work to date. Note however that this is only a guide.

70-100

Sensible subdivision of material into chapters and sections to produce a coherent and well-balanced account. Good introduction chapter that puts the case for the project and its aims. Review is well researched. Thorough understanding of subject. Focussed on topic. Factually correct. Addresses issues critically. Analysis of problem area is in-depth and requirements of project are clear. Project evaluation is addressed with insight and testing is properly covered. Diagrams/maths/tables should be relevant and clearly presented. Unambiguous and grammatically correct English. Perfection is not essential. Some originality or innovation. 80-89: indicates that the work has some originality and with some further work could be of publishable quality. 90-100: indicates originality and work of publishable quality.

60-69

Well-organised with a sensible subdivision of material into chapters and sections. Decent introduction that generally makes the project aims clear. Review shows some evidence of research. Good understanding of subject. Predominantly focussed on topic. Largely factually accurate. May contain some irrelevant material. Analysis is generally good and project requirements are clear. Decent attempt at addressing issues of testing and evaluation. Diagrams/maths/tables should be relevant and clearly presented. Predominantly unambiguous and grammatically correct English.

50-59

Logical structure with sensible subdivision into chapters and sections. Introduction chapter is generally ok. Review is competent but generally exhibits a basic understanding of the subject. Largely focussed on topic. Largely factually correct, but may contain some irrelevant material or miss some important points. Analysis and requirements are adequate. Evaluation and testing is covered. Some use of diagrams/maths/tables, but may be poorly organised. Clearly written overall, but may be ambiguous in places and show lapses of grammar.


## bin

intersection of 2 areas, need to talk about both


the data gathering problem
- long guides
- need more data
- that 2014 study that it's hard

- progress to a more detailed account of the most relevant work in the area, taking care to include some up-to-date references. 

- unanswered questions and issues
- if criticisms, they must come from a place of understanding


The theatre of these exchanges is the online platform.
That increases the importance for automatic processing of that data.
Monologues are represented better on twitter, with threads being a linear structure. Branching structures are less legible.
That can hostilities.

Exposure to alien views is much more common in online communities compared to offline ones (Anand et al, 2012).
On the other hand, homophily is also present (Cinelli et al, 2021) https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2023301118
In any topic, a relatively small number of arguments is repeated multiple times in 'echo chambers'.
Many users base their stance on those most common arguments. These are often expressed in different wording.
Linking textual statements to these abstract arguments is non-trivial. (Boltuzic, Snajder 2015)

There are more appplications to this automatization.
It was remarked ( Carstens and Toni 2015) that there are many applications of the automatic processing of argumentative data,
 such as automated decision making (Bench-Capon et al., 2009) or pro-and-con search engines (Cabrio and Villata, 2012c).
