Assessment

Quality of literature review / technology survey / review of similar software tools:
 The ability to understand/synthesize/combine/evaluate/analyse/categorise relevant work is being considered here.

Quality of overall work (as ascertained from the report):
 This category mainly focuses on the analysis that has been done to date, and which should be complete for most projects. However, since for some types of project the analysis may be ongoing, this category looks at the work as a whole.

Amount of work completed:
 [somewhat self-descriptive] The amount of work done in relation to what could be reasonably expected to be done on the particular project, given its level of difficulty and the time available.

Report presentation: The readability of the report and the precision of its language will be judged here, along with the overall presentation: sensible notation, diagrams, layout, headings, references, etc.

Some of the questions that supervisor and second examiners will consider in marking the report are:

Is the project clearly defined?

Are the objectives attainable?

Does the student know what they are doing?

Does the student have a clear understanding of what is still required in order to produce a satisfactory final dissertation?

Is progress so far satisfactory?

Does the literature survey synthesize information from several sources?

Are sources suitably referenced and is the bibliography/list of citations adequate?

Have potential problems and possible processes/tools/techniques been identified?

Is the writing clear, precise and of the standard to be expected for a degree in science or engineering?

Is the plan of action realistic?

The following list gives an indication of what is being looked for in the overall work to date. Note however that this is only a guide.

70-100

Sensible subdivision of material into chapters and sections to produce a coherent and well-balanced account. Good introduction chapter that puts the case for the project and its aims. Review is well researched. Thorough understanding of subject. Focussed on topic. Factually correct. Addresses issues critically. Analysis of problem area is in-depth and requirements of project are clear. Project evaluation is addressed with insight and testing is properly covered. Diagrams/maths/tables should be relevant and clearly presented. Unambiguous and grammatically correct English. Perfection is not essential. Some originality or innovation. 80-89: indicates that the work has some originality and with some further work could be of publishable quality. 90-100: indicates originality and work of publishable quality.

60-69

Well-organised with a sensible subdivision of material into chapters and sections. Decent introduction that generally makes the project aims clear. Review shows some evidence of research. Good understanding of subject. Predominantly focussed on topic. Largely factually accurate. May contain some irrelevant material. Analysis is generally good and project requirements are clear. Decent attempt at addressing issues of testing and evaluation. Diagrams/maths/tables should be relevant and clearly presented. Predominantly unambiguous and grammatically correct English.

50-59

Logical structure with sensible subdivision into chapters and sections. Introduction chapter is generally ok. Review is competent but generally exhibits a basic understanding of the subject. Largely focussed on topic. Largely factually correct, but may contain some irrelevant material or miss some important points. Analysis and requirements are adequate. Evaluation and testing is covered. Some use of diagrams/maths/tables, but may be poorly organised. Clearly written overall, but may be ambiguous in places and show lapses of grammar.
