\section{Abstract}

This should be two or three short paragraphs (100-150 words total), summarising the report.
A suggested flow is background, project aims, and achievements to date. It should not simply be a restatement of the original project outline.

\section{Chapter 1: Introduction}
- set the scene for the project by giving a little relevant background information - try to grab the reader's interest early.
-  Another is to clearly elucidate the aims and objectives of the project and the constraints 
- If the project involves the solution of a specific problem or the production of a specific system this should be clearly specified in an informal way.
- ginally, the introduction should summarise the remaining chapters of the report, in effect giving the reader an overview of what is to come.

\section{Chapter 2: Literature Survey}
Think of the review as writing an essay on the background literature for your project. 
A good literature survey should demonstrate your awareness and understanding of the background literature to your topic. 
- begin by setting the proposed research in a wide context
intersection of 2 areas, need to talk about both


the data gathering problem
- long guides
- need more data
- that 2014 study that it's hard


- progress to a more detailed account of the most relevant work in the area, taking care to include some up-to-date references. 

- unanswered questions and issues
- if criticisms, they must come from a place of understanding

You should not just provide a list of references followed by a short summary of each of them.
Instead the review should be organised and structured in a meaningful way, and the themes and relationships between the references identified. 
You should expect to redraft the review several times in order to arrive at a text that is clearly written, easy to understand, but that displays an in-depth understanding of the topic.
