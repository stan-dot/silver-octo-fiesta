# introduction

I started this project as a third year CS and AI student after a year in industry.
I have had no prior experience with the Ruby on Rails framework but familiarity with negotiating and then working on a full stack project based on a specification. 
During my placement I closely collaborated in the developer - to - developer basis only with 1 other person. Communications with others were in terms of supervision meetings or asking for advice with a specific technical problem.
I exepcted the main challenges in this module to be - working in a coordinated team of 7, and learning the new technological stack (Ruby on Rails with Bootstrap CSS).


# examples for lessons
I have learnt a number of lessons throughout the project.

- Communication with the client was not perfect. That forced us to operate in conditions of uncertainity and make decisions based on limited data.
- organization of timely meetings - has proven quite useful
- clocked iterations on the process of setting up meetings - using when2meet application we could take into account timetables of all team members.
- remote work discipline - 
- planning out the frontend - missing team member
- updating the kanban board was harder than expected. actually doing tests on time actually. maybe starting from the tests the next time?


# professional issues - security, pricacy and ethics

There is a number of issues regarding the potential security, privacy and ethics concerns in the project. They center around the power of the administrators over the reviews and displayed electives. It is them who decide how each review is judged, and which electives feature on the landing page first. That power is unchecked in the current solution. There is no consensus or feedback mechanism to hold administrators accountable. 
  Decisions of administrators have a big weight. They need to ensure the data is GDPR compliant, with regards to students' description and also points of contact at the hospitals. To ensure that is compliant, the reviews submitted by the students have a declaration field that contacts consent to being contacted. 
Moreover the administrators should be able to moderate succesffuly content made by the students. Reviews submitted by students should be scanned for inappropriate language.
Regarding the ethics choices, when choosing which electives feature on the landing page the administrators make a choice that might be judged variously by the electives. If the criteria for judgement are unclear, a hospital could claim it's arbitrary and discriminating their institution. There is a conflict of interests in that sense.
That all ties into security concerns in a hypothetical scenario of a database leak. That could be a result of a vulnerability in the code or in the hosting environment.
Then the negative conseuqnces could be for all the persons whose data the system contains: students, administrators, contact points at hospitals.
