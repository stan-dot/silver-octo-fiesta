### dead projects
> ransparent, open, public, autopoietic information system. The main idea of TaOPis is to provide a platform for self-organizing communities.

## architecture document
- inflows from different datasets
- gamification database
- temporary events - in partnership would be the best!
- make it work for more people
- actually train the ai
- against a standard set and live dataset
