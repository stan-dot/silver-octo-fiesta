### not too many nodes

it uses owl ontology language
it's semantic, not argumentational
in python + Jupyter noteboook

>  NLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.

# inspirations
## Open source, but lacking in some respect
#### doddle-owl 
extension to the regular OWL
written in JAVA, 2020, Japanese origin, started in 2007 it seems
not interesting at all tbh
https://github.com/doddle-owl/doddle-owl

#### reasonablepy
13 years ago
uses F logic
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-logic
description logic more popular, and OWL uses that
so probably discard
